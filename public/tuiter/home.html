          Angelic Buster is a ranged class, who uses DEX as her main stat. She
          carries a unique weapon of her own called a Soul Shooter and wields
          her secondary weapon, the Soul Ring. Angelic Buster contains very
          unique properties throughout gameplay. You start out like normal, but
          you have the ability to transform into Angelic Buster at will. She
          will wear the appropriate gear and clothing as depicted for her
          character, hiding the player's equipment except her weapon.

          The Dark Lord. It's an unfortunate name, for it brings up images of
          evil and fear. Yet the one who bears that title does so not because he
          is evil, but because he spends so much time in the dark, battling
          against the things that would bring Maple World down. It's a high and
          lonely destiny, one borne well by all those who have carried the
          title.
